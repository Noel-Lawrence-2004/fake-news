# Fake News Detection
This GitHub repository contains code for a fake news classifier implemented using logistic regression and linear regression algorithms. The project aims to distinguish between genuine and fake news articles using supervised learning techniques.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: The repository includes scripts for preprocessing the raw text data, which involves tasks such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and feature extraction.

Model Implementation: The main focus of this repository is the implementation of logistic regression and linear regression models for classification. Both algorithms are applied to the preprocessed data to train classifiers capable of predicting whether a news article is genuine or fake.
